# Scheduling

Scheduling is one of the organizational needs that takes up the most energy and time. 

Broadly speaking there are a couple of basic problem spaces which need to be addressed:

## Peer to Peer Scheduling

Person A and Person B want to meet. They could toss back and forth various times they are open but often the easiest thing to do is for either Person A or Person B to share their available times and let the other person decide which time they want to meet. 

Use cases: someone wants to grab lunch with an old friend, a freelance game developer wants to meet with a freelance artist about working together, a student wants to meet with a professor

Paradigm: individual peer scheduling

## Peer to Group Scheduling

Person A wants to meet with someone from Group B. Booking is very similar to individual scheduling but rather than too individual peers, it is an external client seeking contact with an internal agent. Necessary functionality for this paradigm is the ability for external agents to customize what kind of meeting they are seeking with members of Group B, and to automate the distribution of scheduling between different members of Group B. Ideally, external clients should be able to specify their needs while the organization is able to internally distribute spots. You don't want an external client to have to search through 30 different individual agents calendars to book an appointment.  

Paradigm: external individual choosing to meet with person/s who operate internally to the organization. 

Use cases: business client wants to meet to get a consultation, a group of people want to sign up for spots at a yoga studio

## Public to Private Scheduling

Somtimes you have a bunch of people who need to sign up for slots of time, such as volunteers signing up for times to cover shifts or like people signing up for a yoga class. 

## Peer Group to Peer Group Scheduling
